Q3) Explain about Markup interface?

Ans. An interface that has no member is known as a marker or tagged interface, for
	 example, Serializable, Cloneable, Remote, etc. They are used to provide some
 	 essential information to the JVM so that JVM may perform some useful operations.

Example:

	public interface Serializable{
	
	}

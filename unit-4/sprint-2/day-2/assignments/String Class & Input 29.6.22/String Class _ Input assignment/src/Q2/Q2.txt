Q2) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And
    write some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

Ans. In Java, a string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. there is a
     predefined class in java called String, which belongs to java.lang package, this String
     class is used to create a string object. As Java uses the concept of String literal.
     Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all refer to one object "Masai". If one reference
     variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected by all the reference variables.
     That is why String objects are immutable in Java.

     But, if we want to create a mutable (modifiable) String object, we should use either
     StringBuffer or StringBuilder classes. both classes belong to java.lang package also.



     Methods of String class :

     1. int length(): Returns the number of characters in the String
     2. Char charAt(int i): Returns the character at ith index.
     3. String substring (int i):  Return the substring from the ith index character to end
     4. String substring (int i, int j): Returns the substring from i to j-1 index
     5. String concat( String str): Concatenates specified string to the end of this string.

Q1) What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ?
    explain with an example.

Ans. Keyword 'THIS' in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
     It can be used to refer current class instance variable. It can be used to invoke or
     initiate current class constructor. It can be passed as an argument in the method call.
     It can be passed as argument in the constructor call also.

     Ex - public class Main {
            int x;

            // Constructor with a parameter
            public Main(int x) {
              this.x = x;
            }

            // Call the constructor
            public static void main(String[] args) {
              Main myObj = new Main(5);
              System.out.println("Value of x = " + myObj.x);
            }
          }

     The 'SUPER' keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to immediate
     parent class object.Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of parent
     class is created implicitly which is referred by the super reference variable. Super can be
     used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable. Super can be used to invoke the
     immediate parent class method. Super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

    Ex - class Animal{

         String color="white";

         }

         class Dog extends Animal{

         String color="black";

         void printColor(){

         System.out.println(color);       //prints color of Dog class

         System.out.println(super.color); //prints color of Animal class

         }

         }

         class Main{

         public static void main(String args[]){

         Dog d=new Dog();

         d.printColor();
         }
         }

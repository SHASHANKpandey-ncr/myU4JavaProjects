Q3) What is the difference between List and Set ?
ans. 


1.	The list implementation allows us to add the same or duplicate elements.	
	The set implementation doesn't allow us to add the same or duplicate elements.
	
2.	The insertion order is maintained by the List.	
	Set doesn't maintain the insertion order of elements.
	
3.	List allows us to add any number of null values.	
	Set allows us to add at least one null value in it.
	
4.	The List implementation classes are LinkedList and ArrayList.	
	The Set implementation classes are TreeSet, HashSet and LinkedHashSet.
	
5.	We can get the element of a specified index from the list using the get() method.	
	We cannot find the element from the Set based on the index because it doesn't provide any get method().
	
6.	List is used when we want to frequently access the elements by using the index.	
	Set is used when we want to design a collection of distinct elements.
	
7.	The method of List interface listiterator() is used to iterate the List elements.	
	The iterator is used when we need to iterate the Set elements.

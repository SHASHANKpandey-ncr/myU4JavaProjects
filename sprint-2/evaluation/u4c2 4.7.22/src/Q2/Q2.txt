Q2. Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?

Ans. Method overloading - 
        It is used to increase readability of program.
        It is performed within the classes.
        Its parameters must be diffrent.
        It is example of compile time ploymorphism.

    Method overriding -
        It is used to provide the specific implementation.
        It occurs in 2 classes.
        Its parameters must be same.
        It is example of run time ploymorphism.

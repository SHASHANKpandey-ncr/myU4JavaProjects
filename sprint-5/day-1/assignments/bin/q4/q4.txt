Q4) Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exception?

Ans. Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions:

     1. Checked Exception: The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except
     RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions. For example, IOException,
     SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are called compile-time exceptions because these
     exceptions are checked at compile-time by the compiler.

     2. Unchecked Exception: The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as
     unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,
     ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at
     compile-time, but they are checked at runtime. In simple words, if a program throws an
     unchecked exception, and even if we didnâ€™t handle or declare it, the program would not
     give a compilation error.

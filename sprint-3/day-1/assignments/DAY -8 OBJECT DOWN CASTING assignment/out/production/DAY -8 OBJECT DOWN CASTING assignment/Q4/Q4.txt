Q4. What is instance of operator explain with an example.

Ans. The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the
     specified type (class or subclass or an interface).
     The instanceof operator in java is also known as a type comparison operator because it
     compares the instance with a reference type. It returns either true or false. If we apply
     the instanceof operator with any reference variable that has a null value, it returns false.

     Example:

     class Animal{
           System.out.println("This is Animal class");
     }

     class Dog extends Animal{                    //Dog inherits Animal

         public static void main(String args[]){
         Dog d=new Dog();
         System.out.println(d instanceof Dog);    // output - true
         System.out.println(d instanceof Animal); // output - true
         }

     }
